    "andrewberardinelli" : "If the Packers get to count NFL Championships, then I get to count my 2010 Walpole Fantasy Football League Championship! I'm Andrew Berardinelli, or Nelli (or a whole slew of other variants on that theme), and I've been around the league for a long time.  Once a strong contender in this league, I've fallen off in recent years, mostly due to thinking I'm smarter and better at fantasy than I really am. Maybe one day I'll follow in Daddy's footsteps and win a real WFFL championship... In the meantime I'll continue coming up with nitpicky winter meeting ideas and slogging through writing league power rankings.",
